# Simon-s-Game
One person is Simon, and the other players follow Simon's instructions. Standing in front of the group Simon tells the players what they must do. The players must obey all commands that begin with the words “Simon says”. If Simon says, “Simon says touch your nose” then all players must touch their nose.
